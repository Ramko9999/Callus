Please refer to the following when working with react-native

Before we get into the rules, please do exactly as I tell you. Do not do other things without asking me first.

1. Each component should have its own stylesheet and props type if it requires styles or/and props. The order of definitions in code should be: stylesheet, props and then the component. The name of the stylesheet should be the components name with the first letter lowercase and with "Styles" postpended. The props type should be the component name with "Props" postpended.

For example, if we created a component <Week/>, its stylesheet would be `weekStyles` and its props type would be `WeekProps`. 

2. Leverage the utilies in [styles.ts](mdc:util/styles.ts) whenever defining flex layouts in the style sheets. 

3. Always use <View/> and <Text/> from [Themed.tsx](mdc:components/Themed.tsx).

4. When specifying padding or margins, try to use percentiles instead of absolute values.

5. When working shared values from React Native Reanimated, ensure you access the value of the shared value in the right context and blindly in JS context of the component.

6. Please don't over-comment
